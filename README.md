# CSS-JS-Clock-project
Introducing my latest web project - a sleek and modern digital clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock features a minimalist design that showcases the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The clock face is designed with clean lines and a font that is easy to read, ensuring that the time is always at the forefront.

The clock updates in real-time, so the time is always accurate. The JavaScript code uses the Date object to retrieve the current time and updates the display accordingly. The CSS styles are used to give the clock its sleek and modern look, ensuring that it fits in well with any website design.

Whether you're looking for a functional and attractive way to keep track of the time, or just want to showcase your web development skills, this CSS, JS clock project is the perfect choice. Give it a try today and see how easy it is to create a beautiful and functional clock with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
